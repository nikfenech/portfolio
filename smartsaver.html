      <h3>Discovery</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="small-12 large-9 columns content">
      <p>Smart Saver was the first product I worked on when I joined Moroku - it was tentatively titled just “Uni Demo”, and was a prototype of a savings and financial literacy app targeted at young adults and teens who are entering the job market and looking for a better understanding of the daunting and inaccessible world of managing their own money.</p>
      <p>The purpose of the UX review was to validate that there were real-world use cases for the app to help young Australians’ financial goals.</p>

      <h3>Initial Research</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="small-12 large-9 columns content">
      <p>The first phase of the project consisted of a comparative analysis of competitors and a series of surveys and interviews of people in the target demographic (from around ages 18-25, Australian and likely students beginning their adult life).</p>
      <p>Some of the key findings were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Many cared about personal finance on an abstract level, but weren’t motivated to learn. For example, one survey respondent said this:</li>
        <p class="quote">"I wish I found personal finance interesting coz it's important, right? I just find it extremely boring plus I don't get it. People have explained how business and economics, stock and shares etc. all work lots of times but even if I get it at the time, I don't remember it.""</p>
        <li>While the original prototype had a focus on competition and a leaderboard that compared points earned, many respondents didn’t see this as a major motivator.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One major consideration was that because personal finances are considered a measure of self worth in some ways, there was the possibility of Desirability Bias playing a part in the way some people would respond to these questions.</p>

      <h3>Prototyping</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="small-12 large-9 columns content">
      <p>After presenting Moroku  with my findings, I was asked to build a prototype with a developer to test these proposed solutions. Some of the major changes I proposed were  -</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span class="bolder">Making it a mobile app, rather than an iPad app.</span> Research indicated that the overwhelming majority of our target demographic possessed a smartphone, and frequently used it for financial transactions, while not everybody necessarily used iPads.</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">Implement a notification system.</span>  The prototype required that users manually check to see if they had received a friend request, or when a new quiz became available. I recommended that users be given a clear visual signifier of when something happened - and where - to let them know to check things out.</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">Incentivise goals with clear rewards.</span> The prototype did not inform the players of the points they would earn until after the completion of the task. Consequently, it was easy to lose sight of what they were working on, and lose motivation. I recommended that players’ motivation be reinforced by offering small, upfront point rewards, and explaining how much would be gained with each action.</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">Focus on rewards that were directly linked to finances, rather than extrinsic ones.</span> Rather than nice-to-have rewards such as movie tickets, players could spend their points on rewards which feed into helping them achieve the goals they had set. This could include focussing on existing reward concepts, such as a higher interest rate or introducing new concepts. Points could also be awarded for completing goals early, exceeding the pre-set payment schedule or other “good behaviour” helping to create a success spiral.</li>
        <li><span class="bolder">Allow users to upload images of their goals.</span> Whether it be the house deposit they’ve been saving up for, a new piece of tech or a holiday, I recommended giving them the option of having a tangible, visual representation of their goal. I suggested this replace the generalized “Category” choice that appeared when creating a goal, to give the user something more personal to work towards.</li>
      </ul>

        <h3>User Interviews</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 large-9 columns content">
        <p>I did the user interviews to test the prototype we had built.</p>
        <p class="bolder">Aims:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Moroku wanted to investigate the importance of their “Community” features - there was some internal discussion about the whether community leaderboards were a significant motivating factor.</li>
          <li>Validate changes we’d made and test if users found them engaging and understandable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We managed to find roughly 10 participants -- all university students -- who volunteered some time to sit down and test the new build of the app with us. Each of them performed a small set of tasks, and I transcribed the recordings of these interactions.</p>
        <p class="bolder">Findings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="bolder">The “Community” feature was not motivating to users.</span> The initial prototype included a feature that allowed users to contribute their score towards a 'community' leaderboard and Moroku had previously floated the idea of attaching rewards to that - such as ones they could earn for local sports clubs or community centers. Participants felt a sense of duty and responsibility towards a vague notion of 'community', but had difficulty pinning down what that meant. The vast majority indicated that rather than having funds donated to things like sporting clubs or public works, which they had no personal stake in, they'd prefer that money go towards something that directly benefited them. People’s perception of what constituted 'community' was much smaller than previously assumed and based on different metrics; location wasn't nearly as big of a factor.</li>
          <li><span class="bolder">Our new build had no way to measure indefinite goals.</span> When creating my wireframes, I hadn't accounted for the fact goals may be indefinite and difficult to measure - initial prototypes had no goal system to accommodate for this. Users who were looking for more long-term solutions often would simply look to save as large a sum of money as they could that could one day conceivably be used to buy a house or similar, rather than a specific long-term goal, like a car.</li>
          <li><span class="bolder">Better understanding of behavioural patterns of incidental spending.</span> Interview participants indicated they were often spending small amounts of money and weren’t always aware of it at the time - only to find at the end of the week they’d horrendously overspent. They knew that these things were contributing to poor savings but weren’t aware of it at the time they were spending the money.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h3>Synthesis and Solutions</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 large-9 columns content">
        <p>Based on the feedback and findings of the user interviews, we modified the existing prototype.</p>
        <p class="bolder">Making “Community” more personal</p>
        <p>We reimagined the feature that measured community goals and made it more personal to appeal to the immediate sense of community that participants had expressed in the interviews. Instead of contributing their points towards a goal which would reward the community at large, I created a feature that would allow them to add people to their goal and contribute to it - creating shared goals which would facilitate things like road trips, holidays or events. This was to drive that sense of community engagement but on a smaller and more personal scale.</p>
        <p class="bolder">Adding “Challenges” to curb incidental spending</p>
        <p>In order to address patterns of incidental spending, I designed the Challenges feature. The problem at heart appeared to be with awareness -- if users were aware of their spending patterns, they could proactively check them. The Challenge feature challenged a user to forgo something they felt they were spending too much on. For example, a user could elect to forgo something like coffee for a week and would be asked to deposit an additional $20 at the end of the week to complete the challenge thus earning them a reward.</p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      </div>
      <div class="small-12 large-9 columns content">
        <p>During this project I gained many insights into the spending and savings habits of young Australians. and managed to create something that better suited the needs of the users.</p>
        <p>Going forward I would have liked to explore the financial literacy aspects and create a more robust quiz system that was more engaging to users and flesh out the mechanics of creating and tracking group-based goals.</p>
