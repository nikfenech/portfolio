        <p>Lawbot.ai is an early stage legal startup. It is a contract reviewing platform which generates a report of the legal risks present in an agreement. At the time I started working with them, they had an early prototype of their app, an MVP, which I designed and built on top of. We also ended up adding new features that the earlier versions did not have.</p>
        <p>The focus of Lawbot is its Dashboard, which allows users to upload and interact with contracts for them and their team. My goals for this design were to create something for a user (typically, a lawyer) who was busy and less focussed on the tech than on the way it helped them on their day-to-day tasks.</p>
        <p>I had to ensure that the information onscreen was displayed in an organized way, and that there was a clear and concise information hierarchy so that the page could easily be scanned. I started this process by creating a navigation user flow.</p>

        <p>The main issue in terms of usability was that while Lawbot.ai was a simple app, most of the userâ€™s time and focus would be spent on the Review page. This page also had the most number of user actions -- adding, deleting or editing parties, rerunning the analysis, accepting or rejecting a comment, leaving a note for a coworker, changing the text of the contract itself, and many more -- all essential actions, took place on the Review Page. It was important to keep in mind to not let it get cluttered and overwhelm the user.</p>
        <p>I started by creating a set of early wireframes, prioritizing usability and speed over aesthetics at this stage.</p>
