			<h2>Myer Redesign</h2>
									<h3>Brief</h3>
									<p>The assignment was to redesign the website of Myer, one of the leaders in home decorating retailing. We were told that Myer wished to expand its services to include additional planning and buying options for its customers, and wanted to make it easy for people to find the aesthetic they liked.</p>

									<p>To this end, we had to design the overall layout and global navigation for the site, design a user flow that shows a user choosing a decorating style for a particular room in their house,  design a user flow that addresses how the user’s shopping list can be shared with other people and purchases tracked (considering the invitation, privacy, and any update processes), and design the checkout process.</p>

									<h3>Research</h3>
									<p>For this project, we were given Personas – amalgamations of user research meant to represent specific groups of people. In my case, I chose to focus on a specific persona as the primary user and I would refer back to this during the design process, basing my user flow and tasks off of “Michael”.</p>

									<p>Additionally, this was my first time doing comparative analysis, where I worked in a group looking at Myers’ major competitors. Doing this helped flesh out my understanding of how we can learn from our competitors.</p>

									<h3>Design</h3>

									<p>The design choices I made, such as prioritizing user reviews were the result of the research presented in the persona.  Many icons on the homepage had no labelling and their meanings were not immediately apparent, which linked back to one of the pain points in the persona – “Confusing Navigation”, so I made it a priority when creating my wireframes to ensure all navigation elements were clearly labelled and easily accessible.</p>

									<p>Wireframes were done in MyBalsamiq, a low-fidelity prototyping tool. Balsamiq is fantastic for quickly mocking up ideas without worrying too much about aesthetic.</p>

									<h3>Testing</h3>

									<p>After developing the initial wireframes, I created a set of tasks from my user flows. These were to give context to the usability testing sessions and give the participant something a guideline for their navigation.</p>

									<p>While designing I had assumed that simply highlighting the shopping cart green when users wanted to add something to their shopping car would be adequate feedback, but during testing it became apparent that this wasn’t enough to make it immediately obvious.</p>

									<h3>Iteration</h3>

									<p>After the testing, I iterated on my design based on the problem areas that arose during testing. One of the things I needed to address was the feedback when adding items to cart.</p>

									<p>The test participants weren’t immediately aware and often took a moment to notice where the cart button was or were unsure that something had been added to the cart, so in my iterated design I made sure to add more explicit feedback to show that when the user clicked on the “add to cart” button, they received an appropriate message confirming their action had produced the desired results, and I also added a small callout to direct their eyes to the shopping cart (or, in Myer’s case, bag).</p>
