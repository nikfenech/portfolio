			<h2>Myki Redesign</h2>

									<h3>Discovery</h3>

									<img src="img/kiosk.jpg">

									

									<p>This GA class project, one of the earliest I did, dealt with a very familiar object — the Myki kiosk. The class was split into two groups – half studying Melbourne’s bike share kiosks and the other, the one I was placed in, on the infamous Myki system. The task was to redesign the kiosks and improve them.</p>

									<h3>Research</h3>

									<p>To begin, we were sent off to familiarize ourselves with the kiosk itself and learn its functioning inside out. When we’d learned about the intricacies of its operation, we were sent down to areas where people would be using our respective kiosks (in our case, Flinders St. Station) to find pain points users might be experiencing using the kiosks.</p>

									<p>One of the things I learnt quite quickly is that it’s extremely difficult to get people to open up about their experiences with technology – approaching someone out of the blue and asking if they’d had any trouble with Myki usually received the response “No, everything was fine. It was pretty easy to use.”</p>

									<p>We ended up heading back to the General Assembly buildings and consulting our instructor, Mags, who suggested we simply ask people if we could watch them use the Myki kiosks. This method, called contextual inquiry, yielded much greater results.</p>

									<p>People were much more willing to talk about the problems while experiencing them and we were able to identify several key pain points with the kiosks, most importantly the lack of feedback given when users encountered an error.</p>

									<p>During the research, two major issues arose that I chose to focus on – the people using the kiosks were unsure of the distinction between “Myki Money” and “Myki Pass”, and error messages were poorly explained.</p>

									<p>For example, one particular kiosk was malfunctioning. Commuters were attempting to make payments via debit card, but were unable to do so and the only feedback they were given was “payment could not be completed” which didn’t explain whether the problem was insufficient funds, inability to connect to bank or if their card was inactive. We only discovered through observing several people attempting to unsuccessfully make payments that the fault was with the machine, not to do with their card or anything they had done – something that could easily be avoided with a relevant error message.</p>

									<p>Then back to the GA building, I transferred my notes onto Post-Its – this helped clarify my thoughts, helping me realize just how valuable to the design process it was.</p>

									<p>I then developed a user flow to show the ideal outcome of using a Myki Kiosk. This would be the basis for my wireframe.</p>

									</div>
									<p>At this point we split off individually to create our own wireframes for our proposed solution.</p>

									
									<h3>Wireframes</h3>
									<p>My prototype was designed specifically to address the issues of unclear terminology used and error messages that gave no indication as to what had happened. You can see in the images below that the terms “Myki Money” and“Myki Pass” have been replaced with things that better communicate the concepts – “Top up your Myki” and “Buy a Pass.”</p>

									<p>Wireframes for the project were hand drawn, and I was eased into low-fidelity wireframing with POP, a mobile app which allowed me to turn images into a clickable prototype. While extremely basic, it allowed the same sort of functionality you’d find at a touch-screen kiosk.</p>

									<p>The end product was my first real wireframe and clickable prototype. While not the most professional thing in the world, it was a fantastic learning experience and an introduction to UX methodology.</p>

									<p>You can look at the interactive POP prototype <a href="https://popapp.in/w/projects/55948cde196190bc15f0b734/preview/55948e09196190bc15f0b750">here.</a></p>
