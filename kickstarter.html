			<h2>Kickstarter</h2>

				<h3>Research</h3>

				<p>This assignment was to design a subscription model for Kickstarter, assuming it wanted to expand and incorporate a subscription model, where projects would be funded on a repeated schedule, rather than funding the project only once. We started out by sending off some surveys to determine key user groups – these helped us identify who currently used Kickstarter or other crowdfunding platforms and answer some basic questions we had.</p>
				<p>From our survey results we looked at the key users in each of these groups and conducted interviews with them to determine the behaviours of people who used crowdfunding platforms and how we could help design a better product for them.</p>
				<p>We then looked at the data we had collected and managed to organize them into 3 groups, based on their demographic and behaviours which we developed our personas from – each of which had distinct habits and desires. We then decided which one would be the primary or “power user” who we would design for.</p>

				<p>Once we had completed the research portion of the project, we moved onto a very intense ideation phase. This began as taking our research notes and observations in the form of sticky notes, organizing and categorizing and led onto sketching our ideas onto paper.</p>
				<p>Once we had our wireframes,  I began running usability tests. We managed to get some of our interview participants as well as others to test the initial wireframes, and from this we received some great insights which helped us with our iterations.</p>
				
				<h3>Iteration</h3>
				
				<p>During the testing, the standout problems was the subscription process itself – users were often confused about how far along in the process they were, or whether they had in fact actually completed the process.</p>
				<p>One of the major points of action was to overhaul the subscription process, and add in breadcrumbs to give users an immediate idea of the scope of how long the process would take and at what stage they were at.</p>
