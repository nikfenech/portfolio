    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Nik, I'm an Australian UX Designer. Originally from country Victoria, I'm now based out of Sydney - but always open to somewhere new and exciting.</p>
    <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="www.moroku.com">Moroku</a>, a fintech startup that aimed to gamify banking for from July 2016 to August 2017 and filled a number of roles working on products like <a href="http://moroku.com/smartsaver/">Smart Saver</a>, <a href="http://chorescout.com/">Chore Scout</a> and other enterprise applications in a fast-paced environment.</p>

    <p>I approach solving design problems like solving a puzzle, and make sure I immerse myself in research to understand the needs of the people I’m designing for.</p>

    <p>While I'm primarily a UX Designer, I'm always learning new skills - I taught myself HTML, CSS and Javascript and used it to build this website among others while working at Moroku. Check out my <a href="https://github.com/nikfenech">github</a> and <a href="https://codepen.io/NikFenech/">codepen.</a>

      <p>I’m currently finishing off the Freecodecamp front end certificate. </p>
