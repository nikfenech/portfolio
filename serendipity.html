			<h2>Serendipity</h2>
						
			<p>Serendipity is a new service that connects professionals by sending one email a month randomly introducing two professionals to each other. Serendipity was very well received on <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/tech/serendipity">Product Hunt</a>, and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/@goldenkittymeow/collections/tech-products-of-the-year">nominated for the best Tech Product of the Year (2015)</a>.</p>
			<p>Currently, a lot of the functionality in matching the users and sending the emails is handled on the backend, and there is not much for the user to actually see or interact with. However, Serendipity is now looking to develop a dashboard for users to log in and manage their accounts from. To achieve this, I've worked closely with its founder to develop a UI for users to log in and update or change their preferences or details by styling the existing HTML with CSS.</p>

			<p>Below you can see some images of the interface.</p>
