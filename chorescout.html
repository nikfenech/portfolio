  <h2 class="internal-header">Chore Scout</h2>
  <div class="content-inner">
    <p>While at Moroku, I worked on QA for one of their Flagship products - Chore Scout - and was asked to provide concepts for a redesign of the UI that could provide an incremental improvement in usability going forward.</p>
    <p>I tried to create separate visual identities for each of the parent and child apps. My thought was it would be easier for children to engage with something that was bright and colourful, but an adult using an app with that sort of layout and colour scheme might find it condescending or annoying.</p>
    <p>Some of the aspects of the UI, such as selecting whether the user wanted to upload an image from their phone’s storage or camera weren’t explicitly stated and might not be obvious to a new user - especially a child - so I added additional copy text or separate buttons where necessary to help ensure that any user would be able to differentiate.</p>
    <p>In my wireframes for the Guardian app, I tried to make things as easily scannable as possible - giving elements a simple, unintrusive UI that would allow parents to send money to their children, manage the chores they needed to set for their children without being a burden to them mentally and contributing as little to decision fatigue as possible.</p>

  <div class="content-inner">
    <p>For the child version of the app, I stuck with a high-contrast, bright colour scheme with lots of colour-coding in the hopes that it would make things easier to parse visually and feel more ‘fun’ and incentivise the kids using it to engage with their finances.</p>
